extract_firefox_passwords
=========================

```
extract_firefox_passwords.sh profile_directory master_password
```

Requires `jq` and `pwdecrypt` (in linbss3-utils).  If you have not set a master password, use the empty string.

This is based on the examples at <https://blog.tajuma.com/?p=35>.
