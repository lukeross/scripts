find_deb_cyclic_orphans
=======================

Find deb packages which are not marked as auto-removable because they
participate in a circular dependency loop.

This script was taken from that contributed by gnack at

It got upset on multiarch machines, so I added an easy(-ish) way to exclude
architectures, and I've also updated it to python 3.
