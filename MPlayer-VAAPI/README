MPlayer VAAPI support
---------------------

This is a rather brutal grab of the code from:

<https://github.com/gbeauchesne/mplayer-vaapi/tree/hwaccel-vaapi>

I've turned it into a patch delta, applied it to MPlayer 1.4 and then cleaned
the bits that didn't compile. I've also removed the "-va" switch, so you need
to use it like the VDPAU backend; try this in your ~/.mplayer/config:

```
vo=vaapi,
vc=ffh264vaapi,
```

The original patch I built is in `MPlayer-svn36265-VAAPI.patch` - it's likely
only of interest to those who want to see how my changes compare.

This is a patch to mplayer, so like mplayer is GPLv2+-licensed:
