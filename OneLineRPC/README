One-line RPC
============

This was based on a silly discussion at $job about a colleague who left their
computer unlocked. It runs a daemon that accepts connections and forks a
bash shell for each. The requirements were that it doesn't need any additional
software installing on a typical Linux host, and is short enough to type
in at the keyboard.
